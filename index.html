            The growing presence of technology and digital products e.g. mobile devices,
            computers etc. undoubtedly shape many of our societal constructs today. 
            As society progresses with digital product development, which is becoming 
            more automated, e.g. through the growth of framework platforms, the question
            arises, can we maintain creativity in digital products and digital craft 
            despite the growth of automation and frameworks in digital technology?<br></br>

            It is important to note that as a society we have not yet become mindless 
            robots, and nor have our technological devices become entirely identical. 
            Within the area of digital technology, we are still exploring what identities
            and applications work for various digital devices, and discovering new devices
            and new applications of technological capabilities. In order to fully understand 
            the role and trends of maintaining creativity in digital craft for digital 
            products, it is necessary to examine the components of digital craft, such as
            coding, and how it can be creative, and how frameworks can actually help rather
            than hinder digital creative expression.<br></br>
            The spirit of maintaining digital craft in the digital product field lies
            with coding creatively that coexists and builds upon the foundation of 
            automation and framework platforms (which can be seen through the
            applications of new technologies and discoveries). The very nature of
            code and the foundational principles of programming built on frameworks
            paves the way for a programmer, or anyone who learnt to code the ability
            to create a digital experience. Each person writes code differently. 
            Though there may be a set guideline or principles to follow, the solution
            that stems from coding can be entirely different, with some solutions being
            better than others and or more elegant. The task of writing code itself
            can be an act of creativity. While code is often seen as "computational",
            and "boring", the creative side of coding can be seen and utilized in 
            its application to creating products, solving real world problems, 
            finding solutions and making technological discoveries. Algorithms utilized
            by hospital specialists for example, can spot the likeliness of babies to
            have respiratory failure. Gmail is another is another great example of
            an established framework (an email framework) that was improved upon
            by coding creatively, such as by adding useful features to traditional email. 
            <br></br>
            Code exists within frameworks and many automated systems and frameworks 
            cannot exist without the use of code. While frameworks can be seen as 
            limiting by providing components which are already built out, these components
            can be at the same time, customized  by users for their own purposes. Therefore,
            options of customization in frameworks can be utilized by users to
            enhance creative expression of their digital products. Frameworks enable content
            creation, such as the framework that hosts Youtube which enables digital users
            to create over 10,000 Youtube videos since of March 2015. Frameworks can also 
            be utilized by users to enhance their creative expression for digital craft or
            through digital products. An open source C+++ toolkit, openFrameworks, is a prime
            example of a framework that allows for creative expression through the creation
            of creative code. Creative coding, is an expansive discipline of coding for creating
            something expressive instead of something functional. Designers and media artists
            use creative coding as a form of creative expression for interaction design,
            data visualization and generative art. Processing is another digital platform
            for visual arts, visual arts and visual literacy within technology.
            <br></br>
            As we become more technologically advanced, the growth and knowledge of 
            frameworks and automatic processes have made designing digital products 
            easier if not simpler. Our growing reliance on technology however, has 
            meant a growing desire and need for customization and personalization 
            to achieve unique and memorable user experiences by coding creatively.
            It is through the need of personalization that we are able to maintain 
            the spirit of creative coding in order to provide products that exist
            outside or are designed beyond the use of framework platforms. 
            Though we are no longer living in an era of individually handmade webpages,
            coding creatively enables problem solving to new and old problems, and
            finding creative solutions to processes and even future automated systems.
            <br></br>
            Emerging digital trends have shown that users seem to have a greater need
            for customization and personalization, with a growing emphasis on the
            importance of the user experience. Creative coding is a necessity and not
            a luxury anymore in the field of digital craft, and frameworks and
            automated platforms can serve as a medium to facilitate creative expression.
            Future trends in the digital product field show an increase in the merging
            of art and technology as a number one trend. The public today is exposed now,
            more than ever to technology through the use of personal computers,
            mobile phones and other digital devices. Even if the technology space
            is rapidly growing, with the arrival of virtual reality digital products
            for instance, there will still be a need to humanize technology for the end user.
            It will be interesting to see how and if automated systems and framework designs
            will continue to support personalization. It is certain however, that the spirit 
            of creative coding will continue to exist within the field of digital craft.
